## Testing

If you want to contribut e to this project I have built a test case using mocha , check your work! While you're working in `script.js`, you should only need to refresh your browser to see changes, but once your move to writing code in **presetHandler.js**, you will need to restart your server to test out your work. To stop your server running, use the `Ctrl + C` key command in your terminal and start it again with `npm run start`.

A testing suite has been provided for you, checking for all essential functionality and
edge cases. To run these tests, first open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install all necessary testing dependencies (you will only need to do this step once).
Finally, run `npm run test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed.

As you implement functionality, run the tests to ensure you are creating correctly named variables and functions that return the proper values. The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated when first writing the functions.
